 I am an official <a href="https://westminsterguides.org.uk/" target="_blank" >City of Westminster</a> guide and a qualified English teacher (CELTA/PTTLS/AET). 

 <br />
 <br />
 I am originally from London but have spent time living abroad so I also speak Spanish and French.
 <br />
 <br />
 
 Over the last ten years I have enjoyed teaching English 
  to students from around the world and more recently (pre-covid) 
  showing international tourists my beautiful city.

While waiting for the return of international tourism in London after the pandemic,
I worked briefly as a project manager for an international charity. Most recently
I have been learning to code- HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python!

The lovely woman in the photo was our guide, Joelle. She is a professional tour guide and also an English teacher. So don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre a non native English speaker 
like me. She knows how to explain it to you in simple words.

Joelle was really nice, and knew a lot of history of the different spots, she also was very friendly and talked with me and others one on one, or answering questions regarding other spots around London! I would recommend this tour with her!
