      We will visit the most important sights of Westminster - beautiful parks
      and royal palaces. Sights include- Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, the Houses
      of Parliament, Trafalgar Square and some other great places along the way.
      Take pictures with royal guards and red phone boxes. Hear about lives and
      homes of our legendary Queen and royal family and some of London's
      wealthiest and most powerful people!

      A walk through the City of London and beyond following the River Thames.
Famous landmarks on this tour include St Paul's Cathedral, the Globe Theatre and London Bridge, 
with plenty of selfie spots overlooking the beautiful Tower Bridge. 
We also pass by several sights with movie connections. Find out where Daniel Radcliffe went to school, visit the "Death-Eater"
 Millennium Bridge! As a local Londoner and Harry Potter fan, I can also share tips on other
 wizard-related to-dos.</p>
