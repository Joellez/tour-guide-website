I worked briefly as a project manager for an international charity. Most recently
I have been learning to code- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python!

The lovely woman in the photo was our guide, Joelle. She is a professional tour guide and also an English teacher. So don’t worry if you’re a non native English speaker 
like me. She knows how to explain it to you in simple words.

Joelle was really nice, and knew a lot of history of the different spots, she also was very friendly and talked with me and others one on one, or answering questions regarding other spots around London! I would recommend this tour with her!
