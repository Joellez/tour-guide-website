      We will visit the most important sights of Westminster - beautiful parks
      and royal palaces. Sights include- Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, the Houses
      of Parliament, Trafalgar Square and some other great places along the way.

      A walk through the City of London and beyond following the River Thames.
Famous landmarks on this tour include St Paul's Cathedral, the Globe Theatre and London Bridge, 
with plenty of selfie spots overlooking the beautiful Tower Bridge. 
We also pass by several sights with movie connections. Find out where Daniel Radcliffe went to school, visit the "Death-Eater"
 Millennium Bridge! As a local Londoner and Harry Potter fan, I can also share tips on other
 wizard-related to-dos.</p>

      width="400"
    />
    <p> Looking for something a little different? We discover a less explored side of London's history on this tour- disease, crime, poverty and murder. Hear about Jack the Ripper- the infamous East End serial killer. Also, learn about East London's diverse immigrant communities and take a closer look at some of Brick Lane's wonderful street art.
